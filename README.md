Hi, my name is Anthony, but I usually go by Gus. I am a 4th year aero engineering student. Some of my favorite hobbies are lifting, video games, golfing, and tennis. This semester I am taking 5 courses that are all aerospace courses and almost all of my classes are in howe hall. I am really excited for this year and to get more familiar and prepared with coding.
